	* object_jmm.c:
	Slight tweak to write moffat curve fitting parameters into new w_object variables
	in Object_Calculate_FWHM.

2008-02-05  Engineer  <eng@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object_jmm.c:
	Different curve fitting technique than in previous version, implementing a gradient descent (GD) to "home
	in" on the best fit. Should be faster than brute force method, and more accurate - testing will show. This
	current implementation is using the default settings for the parameter optimisation routine - see the
	"optimise" function called from Object_Calculate_FWHM.

	Also added a slight tweak to write moffat curve "best fit" parameters into new w_object variables
	in Object_Calculate_FWHM.

2008-01-09  Engineer  <eng@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object_jmm.c:
	Implementation in Object_Calculate_FWHM() of a brute force method of fitting a Moffat curve to the radial
	profile of each object. Manual testing on a few test objects shows it fits well to the data and produces
	a FWHM within 0.2 pixels (0.05") of that calculated by IRAF.

	__Radial profile__ entails converting x,y,z -> r,z where r = sqrt((x-xpos)^2 + (y-ypos)^2), i.e. based
	around the barycentre (1st moment). Using a gsl routine for this as it executes a little faster than
	standard sqrt math lib function and we have a lot of pixels to work on.

	__Moffat curve__ is a better fit to a stellar radial profile than a gaussian, and is given by the equation
	y = k * [ 1 + (x/a)^2 ]^(-b), where k = peak at x=0 and a,b are parameters to find. 'k' can be set to the
	nearest (brightest) pixel to the barycentre as it's close enough.

	This version (coded in December 2007) uses a crude scan through a range of a,b values to find the best fit,
	purely to enable testing on a large number of objects in many frames.

	* object_jmm.c:
	Thought some tweaks here were necessary to enable testing of Chris Simpson's idea
	of a FWHM workaround, but turns out it could all be done in object_test_jmm.c
	instead. Initially added code was then deleted again, so apart from some different
	whitespace, the code in this version therefore should be no different from that
	in the previous version.

2007-11-14  Engineer  <eng@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object_jmm.c:
	Added extra debugging to print out pixel lists for objects. (CJM)

2007-11-08  john  <jmm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object_jmm.c: Lots of changes...!

2007-09-18  john  <jmm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object_jmm.c: New file.

2007-05-17  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* Makefile: static changes.

2006-09-28  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c:
	Changed "All objects were too small" to be a warning - TRUE returned from Object_List_Get
	with a NULL object list, and fake seeing etc.
	This gives it the same response as "No objects found".

2006-06-29  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c:
	Object_Calculate_FWHM now calculates FWHM even if is not stellar (AG change).

2006-05-25  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c:
	Added is_stellar,fwhmx, and fwhmy to the Object_Struct for better seeing determination in client code.

2006-05-16  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c: gnuify: Added GNU General Public License.

2005-03-04  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c:
	Added DEFAULT_BAD_SEEING and changed bad seeing from 10 pixels to 999 pixels,
	for archive searches.

2005-01-27  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c:
	Changed faked seeing results to 10 pixels from 2 - gives bad seeing measure even
	in binning 1.
	Added documentation and prints to say calculated seeing in pixels - conversion done
	in rjs_dprt.c:dprt_process.

2004-11-22  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c:
	If Object_Get_List finds no objects in the frame, it now generates a warning and returns TRUE.
	The returned object list is NULL.

2004-08-06  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* Makefile: New makedepend path option.

2004-02-06  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c: Added reset of Object_Error_Number.

	* object.c: Added protection for no stellar sources.

2004-01-30  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c: Ensure top of list is set to NULL.

2004-01-29  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* object.c: Added Object_Get_Error_Number.

	* Makefile:
	Reduced and commented LOGGING level, performance enhancement.
	Added MEMORYCHECK CFLAGS for the insane.

	* object.c: Performance optimisation, of logging routines.

2004-01-26  Chris Mottram  <cjm@ltdevsrv.astro.livjm.ac.uk>

	* Makefile, object.c: New file.
